# Ipsos-Inspired Market Research Project

## Overview
Hey I'm Zak! One thing I was really excited to do was simulate a project going over how researching in the role I was applying to would be. Using AI and some of my own creative questions, I was able to simulate a process that goes over what a research analyst might encounter and the types of skills needed. Clearly, being a natural problem solver and being able to communicate effectively while also delivering high-quality work is key. 

This project simulates an end-to-end market research study inspired by Ipsos' methodology. The goal is to design a questionnaire for a retail company, test its validity, simulate collaboration with internal teams, collect and clean data, and present actionable business insights. This repository documents each phase of the project.

## **Project Methodology**

### **1. Questionnaire Development**
When it comes to designing a good questionnaire, one of the most important aspects is asking questions that can directly lead to product recommendations. In this consumer survey, the goal was to have shoppers with a loyalty card that shop frequently at the store participate in exchange for a $10 gift card. This ensures more insightful responses rather than a large-scale optional survey that gets completed quickly without care.

Key points of consumer demographics, such as age, gender, income, and location, help the company understand which consumer profile to target more in their marketing. This, combined with targeted questions to gauge the consumer mindset toward sustainable products, forms the foundation of this questionnaire and drives insights for better decision-making.

Another key point was trying to find issues as to why consumers were not leaning toward sustainable products. I wanted to see whether price, quality, lack of awareness, or simply a lack of interest in sustainability was the reason behind low adoption. Identifying the biggest issue is important before recommending solutions on how the company should market to change the consumer experience. I also aimed to gauge whether people still see value in sustainable products by asking, "If pricing was similar, would you buy the sustainable product?" In this case, I wanted to examine if people are put off by quality concerns or if price is the biggest hurdle. This, along with demographics of the customers, is crucial when designing recommendations to improve the consumer experience at a company.

- A consumer survey was designed to assess preferences and barriers toward sustainable product adoption.

### **2. Quality Assurance (QA) Testing**
In the quality assurance stage, the goal was to validate accuracy and functionality to ensure a seamless respondent questionnaire and remove any logical errors. Another goal was to remove bias through question wording and provide more varied options in multiple-choice questions. Adding definitions to terms like "carbon footprint" and "circular economy" helps respondents who may not be educated on these terms, yet may still fall into the category. This creates a more accurate response from a subsection of respondents who might have otherwise just chosen the only familiar term they saw.

Another change to the survey was question grouping on redundant questions. Questions 5 and 6 were both redundant under shopping behavior, so their combined elements ensured efficiency and more meaningful insights.

- Ensured question clarity, correct logic flow, and accurate data capture.
- Conducted pilot testing and documented the results.

### **3. Collaboration with Internal Teams**
A research analyst role requires effective collaboration with multiple teams to ensure seamless execution of a research project. In this simulation, I worked on structuring internal communication as if I were working with data processing and QA teams.

One of the key exchanges involved ensuring that the survey data was structured properly for analysis. I simulated email discussions with the "data team" to confirm the expected formats for categorical, numerical, and open-ended responses. I also engaged in troubleshooting a skip logic error that could have resulted in respondents skipping key questions. 

This phase helped me practice structuring professional communication and documenting issues in a way that internal teams can quickly understand and resolve.

- Simulated communication with data processing and QA teams to ensure survey readiness.
- Mock emails were exchanged to address technical implementation and data structuring.

### **4. Data Collection & Verification**
Once the questionnaire was completed, the next phase was ensuring the collected data was structured correctly and free from inconsistencies. This involved analyzing how missing values, duplicate responses, and inconsistent entries were handled.

For example, I simulated a dataset where some demographic responses were missing and applied logical rules to infer missing data where applicable. Additionally, I identified and removed duplicate responses using timestamp and IP address checks, ensuring the dataset remained clean. 

By running quality checks on scale-based responses, I was able to flag anomalies (e.g., responses outside the expected 1-5 range) and document a structured approach to handling inconsistencies before moving forward with analysis.

- Simulated survey data was collected and processed for inconsistencies.
- Applied business logic to validate response accuracy.

### **5. Customer Segmentation Analysis**

Once the data was validated, I created clusters based on user behavior and sustainable shopping preferences. This segmentation revealed four key personas with unique motivations and obstacles toward sustainable purchasing. These insights can be used to develop more effective marketing campaigns and tailored product recommendations.

- Segmented respondents into behavioral clusters using survey attributes.
- Identified high-potential customer groups for targeted sustainable product strategies.

## **Key Business Insights**
1. **Survey Optimization:** Improved question clarity to reduce contradictory responses.
2. **Consumer Segmentation:** Identified the key drivers influencing sustainable product purchases.
3. **Data Validation Strategy:** Implemented quality checks to improve survey data integrity.

## **Conclusion**
This project was an exciting deep dive into what a research analyst role truly entails. From designing the questionnaire to ensuring data integrity and crafting meaningful insights, I got firsthand experience in balancing consumer feedback with business objectives. The biggest takeaway from this study was how small adjustments in survey design—such as clearer definitions, improved question flow, and incentives—can lead to significantly better data collection. 

Through this process, I gained stronger problem-solving skills, learned how to document and communicate research findings effectively, and reinforced my ability to work in a structured research-driven environment. This project made me even more confident in my ability to approach real-world research challenges with both critical thinking and a strategic mindset.
