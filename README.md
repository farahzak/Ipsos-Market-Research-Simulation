# Ipsos-Inspired Market Research Project

## Overview
One thing I was really excited to do was simulate a project going over how researching in the role I was applying too would be. Using Ai and my own creative questions, I was able to simulate a process that goes over what a research analyst might encounter and the types of skills needed. Clearly being a naturl problem solver and being able to communicate effectively while also delivering high quality work is the key. This project simulates an end-to-end market research study inspired by Ipsos' methodology. The goal is to design a questionnaire, test its validity, simulate collaboration with internal teams, collect and clean data, and present actionable business insights. This repository documents each phase of the project.

## **Project Methodology**


### **1. Questionnaire Development**
- A consumer survey was designed to assess preferences and barriers toward sustainable product adoption.
- **[View the Questionnaire (PDF)]([https://github.com/farahzak/Ipsos-Market-Research-Simulation/raw/main/ipsos_questionnaire.pdf](https://github.com/farahzak/Ipsos-Market-Research-Simulation/blob/21982fb06d277190483fee383ed5a6e306da0d78/Questionnaire_%20Ipsos-Inspired%20Market%20Research%20Study.pdf))**

### **2. Quality Assurance (QA) Testing**
- Ensured question clarity, correct logic flow, and accurate data capture.
- Conducted pilot testing and documented the results.

### **3. Collaboration with Internal Teams**
- Simulated communication with data processing and QA teams to ensure survey readiness.
- Mock emails were exchanged to address technical implementation and data structuring.

### **4. Data Collection & Verification**
- Simulated survey data was collected and processed for inconsistencies.
- Applied business logic to validate response accuracy.
- **[View Data Verification Report (PDF)](https://github.com/farahzak/Ipsos-Market-Research-Simulation/raw/main/data_verification_report.pdf)**
