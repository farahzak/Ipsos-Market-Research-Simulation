 Ipsos-Inspired Market Research Project

## Overview
This project simulates an end-to-end market research study inspired by Ipsos' methodology. The goal is to design a questionnaire, test its validity, simulate collaboration with internal teams, collect and clean data, and present actionable business insights. This repository documents each phase of the project.
